# el-the-robot
I was just messing around with html and css and came up with this basic robot.

For now i got no idea what i want the robot to do or how it should function.
The fonts and colors are temporary and some parts might not contrast well, just like i said, i was just messing around.

I am thinking of turning it into an open source project where fellow developers can come and play around and add awesome features to the code base and make the robot functional. In the nearest future i will give it a purpose and bring the project alive.

Anyone got good ideas? Feel free to reachout let's contribute to making the web awesome
